Just a Digital Clock and Digital Themometer I build using an Arduino Nano, a RTC, a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor a few Shift-Registers and six Seven Segment Displays.
It was an X-Mas present for my Grandpa. Later I swapped the Nano (Classic) with an Nano Every, as I needed the Nano Classic for something else.

Rest in Peace Grandpa.
